I use a script like this to make it easier to manage a lot of xterm configs
that are mostly ssh to unix boxes.

For example put it as ~/x/box.sh and create directory ~/x/box/

Start the script with the argument of the name of the config file

For example

~/x/box.sh bud
~/x/box.sh fan

These would load the settings in ~/x/box/bud.txt or ~/x/box/fan.txt respectively

A couple of example are included in ./box/

For example the localhost one overrides the command to just start bash instead
of ssh.

The main point is to bind them to keyboard shortcuts in the desktop and quickly
fire off familiar colored terminals representing the different stations. It's 
kind of similar to PuTTY's sessions.
